# FRE-6883

Group consisting of Steven, Xiongan, Zhitong, Lisa, and Ning

## Tasks and deadlines
### Pull earnings dates and values from Bloomberg for S&P500 stocks:
Xiongan, End-of-day 11/4
- Calculate Surprise
- Sort Surprise into Beat, Meet, Miss

### Sample 30 stocks from each of 3 groups (90 total):
Steven and Zhitong, Friday afternoon 11/6
 - Sample 30 stocks from each of 3 groups randomly
 - Download 61 days of data for SPY and the sampled stocks around the earnings date
 - Prepare a loop that will do this, and the following block, 30 times.
 
 ### Calculate statistics from collected data:
 Lisa and Ning, Monday afternoon 11/9
 - Make sure the code is suited for repeating 30 times! This will be a Monte Carlo simulation
 - Calculate returns on all stocks and SPY per day, per stock.
 - Calculate abnormal return on all stocks, per day.
 - For each group (Beat, Meet, Miss), for each day, calculate average daily abnormal return (AAR) of all stocks in that day.
 - Calculate Cumulative AAR (CAAR)
 - Make sure the code is suited for repeating 30 times! This will be a Monte Carlo simulation
 - After running code 30 times (with 30 different randomly selected stocks each time), average the AAR and CAAR for each day across all runs, and the standard deviation of each day across all runs.
 
 ### Plot data
 TBD, Before Tuesday 11/10 if possible, by Thursday 11/12 at latest.
 - Using gnuplot, plot the data.
 
 ## Final deadline: 11/14
